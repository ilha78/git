# Git

## Setup

Clone the repository and make sure to **delete .git** before running any of the scripts as the actual git will conflict in names with my git (can be done by running `rm -rf .git` on Linux). 

Run `PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)"` to avoid having to prefix `./` for each script execution.

## Available scripts

`git-init`

`git-add`

`git-commit`

`git-rm`

`git-status`

`git-log`

`git-show`

`git-branch`

`git-checkout`

`git-merge`

## Learn More

The details can be found in the [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/)

I learnt lots from [Atlassian Explains Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/glossary#commands) and further commands can be implemented.
